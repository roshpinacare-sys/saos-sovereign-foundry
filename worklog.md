Task ID: 1
Agent: Z.ai Code (main orchestrator)
Task: Full independent EVM/DeFi audit of the SAOS/THE WEAVE 16-repo org (roshpinacare-sys) + critical engineering fixes

Work Log:
- Downloaded pat.rar from filebin (password provided), extracted GitHub fine-grained PAT
- Cloned all 16 repos (shallow) to /home/z/audit
- Launched 4 parallel Explore agents: kernel/weave-protocol audit, Solidity mesh contracts audit, saos-dex audit, infra/CI/truth-claims audit
- Independently reproduced 3 critical kernel PoCs (host-mint, state-pollution on reject, wrap_mint ref-ring replay)
- Implemented HARDEN_FORK_HEIGHT=224000 in Zip/saos-verify/sovereign/core/kernel.cjs: host credit limit, pure-lookup validation (no state mutation on reject across 13 ops), permanent wrap refs + strict amounts; added selfTestHarden() vectors
- Hardened console/saos-live.js recoverPub: r/s range + low-s enforcement
- Hardened saos-sovereign-platform contracts: SAOSLedger (MINT_CAP 21M, 2-step ownership, approve/transferFrom), SAOSExchange (attributed deposit via transferFrom, race closed), SAOSBridge (monotonic anchors, zero-digest reject); updated deploy.ts + exchange-live.ts callers
- Compiled all 11 contracts clean (solc 0.8.36 cancun)
- Added truth-correction section to Zip/SAOS.md (x1000 unit gap, no sig verification in v0, false wrapped-asset claims, snapshot-relative verification)
- Pushed branches: Zip@audit-hardening-20260928, saos-sovereign-platform@audit-contracts-20260928 (PR creation blocked by token scope)

Stage Summary:
- Verification: kernel --selftest EXIT=0 all roots byte-identical; chain replay FULLY VERIFIED root 29778d14... unchanged; saos-live selfTest 30/30; contracts compile clean
- Key verdicts: engine deterministic-but-unauthenticated; anchoring real but self-referential; DEX is operator-only simulation (0 deposits ever); mesh contracts anvil-only, never on Z Chain 9369; one master password + leaked vault passphrases = existential key risk; sovereignty rented from GitHub
