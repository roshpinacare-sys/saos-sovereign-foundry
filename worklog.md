Task ID: 1
Agent: Z.ai Code (main orchestrator)
Task: Full independent EVM/DeFi audit of the SAOS/THE WEAVE 16-repo org (roshpinacare-sys) + critical engineering fixes

Work Log:
- Downloaded pat.rar from filebin (password provided), extracted GitHub fine-grained PAT
- Cloned all 16 repos (shallow) to /home/z/audit
- Launched 4 parallel Explore agents: kernel/weave-protocol audit, Solidity mesh contracts audit, saos-dex audit, infra/CI/truth-claims audit
- Independently reproduced 3 critical kernel PoCs (host-mint, state-pollution on reject, wrap_mint ref-ring replay)
- Implemented HARDEN_FORK_HEIGHT=224000 in Zip/saos-verify/sovereign/core/kernel.cjs: host credit limit, pure-lookup validation (no state mutation on reject across 13 ops), permanent wrap refs + strict amounts; added selfTestHarden() vectors
- Hardened console/saos-live.js recoverPub: r/s range + low-s enforcement
- Hardened saos-sovereign-platform contracts: SAOSLedger (MINT_CAP 21M, 2-step ownership, approve/transferFrom), SAOSExchange (attributed deposit via transferFrom, race closed), SAOSBridge (monotonic anchors, zero-digest reject); updated deploy.ts + exchange-live.ts callers
- Compiled all 11 contracts clean (solc 0.8.36 cancun)
- Added truth-correction section to Zip/SAOS.md (x1000 unit gap, no sig verification in v0, false wrapped-asset claims, snapshot-relative verification)
- Pushed branches: Zip@audit-hardening-20260928, saos-sovereign-platform@audit-contracts-20260928 (PR creation blocked by token scope)

Stage Summary:
- Verification: kernel --selftest EXIT=0 all roots byte-identical; chain replay FULLY VERIFIED root 29778d14... unchanged; saos-live selfTest 30/30; contracts compile clean
- Key verdicts: engine deterministic-but-unauthenticated; anchoring real but self-referential; DEX is operator-only simulation (0 deposits ever); mesh contracts anvil-only, never on Z Chain 9369; one master password + leaked vault passphrases = existential key risk; sovereignty rented from GitHub

Task ID: 2-a..2-f
Agent: fleet-agent-A (Z.ai Code · שיחת-המקור · main orchestrator)
Task: Activate the whole system with the 3-agent fleet — merge hardening to main, build the trigger grid (דבר-גורר-דבר), prove the $1000/day mission honestly

Work Log:
- 2-a: Pushed FLEET-LOG.md (inter-agent protocol, lanes, commit conventions) to Console main (9004c3f)
- 2-b: Merged hardening branches to main: Zip@2d16613 (kernel HARDEN fork 224000, selftest EXIT=0 post-merge) + saos-sovereign-platform@b069b3e (hardened contracts)
- 2-c: Activation sweep — kernel selftest EXIT=0, dex peg-selftest 34/34, mission selftest 11/11, grids selftest 9/9; diagnosed 5 degraded agents (root cause: private-repo Actions minutes quota + missing secret; gitleaks failures are config not real leaks — local secret scan clean); wrote Console/SYSTEM-ACTIVATION-REPORT.md; subagent fix for console-publish RPC resilience (3rd Steem node + retry) merged
- 2-d: BUILT saos-dex/grids/ — the thing-drags-thing trigger network: JSONL event bus, trigger-DAG rules (loop guards depth-8/fires-64), 4 micro-grid strategies as economic executors (mm-grid, micro-arb, sweep, anchor-quote), deterministic engine, runner CLI (one-shot/loop/selftest), seed state, grid-trigger.yml Action. Selftest 9/9 x3; live tick measured real Steem feed_price + weave anchor cp#813; 20-tick loop: 33 sim fills, 0 invariant violations. Fixed real bugs: naked-short fills (escrow-honest now), pre-tick invariant gate, gitignore unanchored state/ pattern that silently dropped the seed state from the repo
- 2-e: BUILT saos-dex/mission/ — honest $1000/day harness: model.mjs (measured capital $4,501.19 via public RPC, exact SP via get_dynamic_global_properties, break-even table, fuel flow $4.39/day cross-referenced from AGENT-Z KPI.json), simulate.mjs (deterministic 90d), selftest.mjs (11/11), MISSION-1000.md (measured truth + ramp path + operator gates)
- 2-f: Discovered AGENT-Z's fleet coordination (Defi/fleet/) — registered as AGENT-A, filed claims A-1..A-4 DONE + CLAIMED B-1, sent broadcast, resolved a CLAIMS.md rebase race preserving both agents' rows. All pushed to main across Console/Zip/platform/saos-dex/Defi

Stage Summary:
- System verdict: fabric ALIVE and verified (kernel/anchors/52 agents/trigger grid); real measured revenue $4.39/day (SP fuel) vs $1000/day target — gap documented with full break-even math ($33K–$16.7M capital depending on capture/turnover), operator gates X-1 (key rotation) and X-2 (capital) remain the blockers, exactly as AGENT-Z ladder defines
- Inter-agent coordination worked in practice: two agents converged on shared files, protocol held (no deletions, evidence-linked claims)
- Artifacts: saos-dex/grids/ + saos-dex/mission/ + Console/SYSTEM-ACTIVATION-REPORT.md + Console/FLEET-LOG.md + Defi/fleet/{AGENTS,CLAIMS,broadcast}
