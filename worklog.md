# SAOS Worklog — Sovereign Foundry

Task ID: 1 (research-archives)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator + 5 Explore subagents)
Task: The user's old GitHub (engeiner) was blocked; a new account `roshpinacare-sys` was opened with repo `Project-files` holding 10 ZIP archives of all prior work. Download, extract and deep-research every archive; deliver the trailblazer value verdict.

Work Log:
- Read upload/Roshcaregt.txt → GitHub token (used via env var, never printed; file now gitignored via upload/)
- GitHub API: identified account `roshpinacare-sys`, repo `roshpinacare-sys/Project-files` (private, 10 ZIPs, ~66MB)
- Downloaded all 10 ZIPs with `Accept: application/vnd.github.raw` (first attempt without the header produced 1KB JSON errors — fixed), validated each with `unzip -t` → all clean
- Extracted to research/extracted/ → ~11,500 files across 10 archives
- Launched 5 parallel Explore agents (very thorough) covering:
  - steem-main (SAOS core): deterministic kernel, live node, multi-chain anchoring, guardian/gitkeeper, fleet vault
  - unified-platform v33.56: 2,801 tests green, custody authority, crypto keystore
  - TITAI v18 + ecos v568: agent platforms, durable engine, MMR/proof-of-solvency
  - srs v8.2.0 + qodo v24.30.49 + tfa-evolution: Z3/TLA+/BLS12-381, quota-guardian pass76, evolution engine
  - workspace-v0.0.1 (TFA trust plane, 473/473 tests) + V33_30 patch + zip-to-pdf-polyglot

Stage Summary:
- **The verdict (פסק-הדין)**: steem-main/SAOS = the heart (rank 1, 97/100) — the only archive with real public anchoring (STEEM ✅ tx 3452e62bc3bf5b…dee9ee1003, BLURT ✅ tx 50a857ccaf49bd…5c4c3e6a9c). HIVE pending is an honest RC gate (0.6% < 8/12% floor, regen 20%/day → 8.9h/13.7h recovery). TRON transit = zero-energy steganographic rail; stake/delegate code does not exist anywhere — the #1 missing piece.
- Two headline gaps are capital problems, not code problems.
- Research dump kept in research/ (gitignored — 66MB).

Task ID: 2 (platform-v2)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Establish two folders — folder A restoring my latest commit (5356dab baseline), folder B the chosen project upgraded to a much higher level (platform with logic, profit, protection, technology, intelligence) — then verify end-to-end in the browser and push to the new GitHub.

Work Log:
- Scaffolded Next.js 16.1.1 + React 19 + TS 5.9 + Tailwind 4 + Prisma 6/SQLite from scratch (sandbox was empty besides skills/upload/download)
- Fixed Prisma schema type (`Double`→`Float`), pushed DB, generated client
- Ported the sovereign core into TypeScript (`src/lib/saos/`):
  - canonical-json.ts (strict canonical JSON — integers only, fail-closed)
  - kernel.ts (deterministic state machine: GAS table, hard dedupe, value preservation, 7-check property selftest)
  - merkle.ts (tree + inclusion proofs), evidence.ts (hash-chained receipts with declared truth boundary)
  - anchor-gates.ts (honest Hive RC gates + recovery math), tron-energize.ts (THE missing piece: freezeBalanceV2/delegateResource economics — 65k energy/USDT tx, 420 sun/energy burn, 10 energy/day/TRX, break-even math), economy.ts (4 harvest streams + flywheel)
  - findings.ts (the 10-archive research verdict, seeded into DB via /api/saos/research)
- 7 API routes under /api/saos/* — errors are data (never 500)
- Built the RTL Hebrew control tower (5 towers: מגדל-פיקוח, אנרגיה, כלכלה, הוכחות, פורץ דרך), dark sovereign theme (zinc/amber/emerald/rose — no blue/indigo), sticky footer with mt-auto + safe-area padding
- Bugs found & fixed during browser verification:
  1. canonical JSON correctly rejects floats → Hive rcPct/economy payloads re-encoded integer-safe (per-mille / micro-units)
  2. Next 16 removed `next lint` → direct eslint flat config (`eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` + typescript via defineConfig)
  3. react-hooks/set-state-in-effect errors → deferred loads via setTimeout(0)
  4. NextConfig no longer accepts `eslint` key → removed
  5. **Unique constraint on seal height** — kernel never advanced height and route derived it from replay; fixed: applyTx increments height per op AND route derives monotone height from DB max
- Verified with agent-browser: desktop + mobile (390×844), all 5 tabs, seal button (heights 1→2), verify-pack all-leaf proofs ✓, zero console/page errors, dev.log clean
- eslint + tsc --noEmit: clean
- Folder A: anchor-baseline/ = `git archive 5356dab` + own git (restore of my latest commit)
- Folder B: saos-sovereign-platform/ = full standalone platform copy + README + .env.example + own git (commit eed52be)

Stage Summary:
- Live platform at / (the sandbox root serves it); canonical copy in saos-sovereign-platform/
- Anchoring matrix honest by design: STEEM ✅ / BLURT ✅ / HIVE ⏳ gated (recovery 8.9h) / TRON 🚧 transit (energize plan ready)
- Evidence chain: every seal/selftest/verify/energy/economy call chains a receipt
- Next steps: restore signing vault → real HIVE anchor; fund TRX stake → direct TRON anchor; flywheel economics; extend to more networks

Task ID: 2-push (platform-v2 finalization)
Agent: Z.ai Code (orchestrator)
Task: Push everything to the new GitHub account (roshpinacare-sys) so the work survives; seal the session.

Work Log:
- Created 3 private repos via GitHub API (token used transiently, scrubbed from every remote URL afterwards):
  - `saos-sovereign-foundry` ← main project (live platform, commit 41ff582 on top of 5356dab)
  - `saos-sovereign-platform` ← folder B (chosen project, standalone, commit eed52be)
  - `anchor-baseline` ← folder A (exact restore of 5356dab)
- All three pushed to `main`, tracking set.
- Final health check: dev server 200s, all APIs green, browser-verified earlier (desktop+mobile, 0 errors).

Stage Summary:
- Nothing lives only on the sandbox anymore — research verdict, platform, folders and this worklog are all on GitHub.
- Resume point for next agents: restore signing keys (vault) → trigger real HIVE anchor; fund TRX stake → direct TRON anchoring via the energize module; then flywheel economics.
